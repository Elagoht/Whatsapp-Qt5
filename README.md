<h2 id="0">What is Whatsapp-Qt5</h2>

This app is an unofficial linux client for whatsapp web that can minimize to tray. It powered by PyQt5. On Ubuntu, we dont have a good whatsapp client. I realized this deficiency and developed this client in one day. I'm using this client and hopefully it would be useful for you.

<h2 id="1">It's Open-Source</h2>

Yes, I published it under GNU GPLv3. So, you can upgrade source code.

<h2 id="2">Installation</h2>

Download package, open a terminal on that directory, and write command below:

> sudo ./install.sh
